## Flask Application Design

**HTML Files**

- **news.html**: This HTML file will be the main page of the application, displaying a list of recent news articles. It will also provide a form for users to search for news articles based on a keyword.

**Routes**

- **/**: This route will handle the main page of the application, loading the news.html file.
- **/search**: This route will handle the search functionality. It will take a keyword as a GET parameter and redirect the user to the /results page with the search results.
- **/results**: This route will display the search results. It will query the news API using the keyword and display the results on a results.html page.

**Additional Notes**

- To display the news articles, you can use a templating engine such as Jinja2 to dynamically generate the HTML based on the data retrieved from the news API.
- To handle the search functionality, you can use the request object in Flask to access the GET parameters.
- To query the news API, you can use a third-party library such as newsapi for Python.

This design provides a basic structure for a Flask application that can display recent news articles and allows users to search for articles based on keywords. You can further customize and enhance the application as needed to meet your specific requirements.
